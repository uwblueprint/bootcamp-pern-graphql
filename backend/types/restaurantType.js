/**
 * type definitions for a restaurant entity
 * this should look pretty familiar if you've worked with statically typed object-oriented languages before
 * 
 * some things to note:
 * - an exclamation mark denotes a non-nullable type
 * - built-in primitive types like String, Int, ID, Float, and Boolean are called scalars. Custom scalars can be defined
 * - ID is a special type representing a unique identifier. It is serialized as a String in responses, but it is NOT actually a String
 * - nested under "extend type Query { ... }", we have signatures for 2 queries. They are like method declarations, with parameters and return types
 * - similarly, nested under "extend type Mutation { ... }", we have signatures for 3 mutations
