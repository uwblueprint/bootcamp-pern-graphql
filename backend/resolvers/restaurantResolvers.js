/**
 * from the Apollo docs: a resolver is a function that's responsible for populating the data for a single field in your schema
 *
 * for each of our queries and mutations, we must define how the fields in their results are computed
 * suppose we are executing this query (finding the restaurant with id = 1 and returning all of its fields):
 *
 * {
 *   restaurant(id: 1) {
 *     id
 *     name
 *     address
 *     type
 *     budget
 *     description
 *     rating
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * we expect this response:
 *
 * "restaurant": {
 *   "id": "1",
 *   "name": "Campus Pizza",
 *   "address": "160 University Ave W #2, Waterloo, ON N2L 3E9",
 *   "type": "Pizzeria",
 *   "budget": "LOW",
 *   "description": "giant slices, affordable prices",
 *   "rating": 2
 * }
 *
 * the resolver for the restaurant Query (lines 42-44) fetches the necessary data through restaurantService and serializes the requested fields for the response
 * (the serialization is automatically handled by Apollo)
 * note the arguments for the resolver function:
 * - the first, _parent, is currently unused, but it contains the previously resolved field
 * - the second consists of arguments to the query / mutation (using destructured syntax in this case)
